We use jest combined with React testing library to test our frontend components, and redux-saga-test-plan to test sagas. ðŸ¥³

When mocking things in tests, be it an API call, saga generator functions or Atlaskit modules. I always seem to forget which mock is the right one for the current use case.
Given this problem, Iâ€™ve made it easier for myself by _**Note:**mocking up_ this cheatsheet with a 1â€“2 line explanation about the mock. Hope it helps you too!

## Use case: Mock the implementation of a function defined in another file.

### 1. Using `MockImplementation()`

The function being imported needs to be marked as a `jest.fn()` before we can call `mockImplementation` on it.

```js
// Import the real function 
import { getThirdLevelSettings } from "../client/thirdLevel";

// Provide function with correct mock function typing using jest.mocked
const getThirdLevelSettingsMock = jest.mocked(getThirdLevelSettings);

// Mark function as a jest mock
jest.mock("../client/thirdLevel", () => ({
    getThirdLevelSettings: jest.fn(),
}));

// Once you have a mocked function, call mockImplementation on it 
getThirdLevelSettingsMock.mockImplementation(() => {
    return Promise.resolve({
        ...{
            issueTypeId: "issueTypeId",
            linkDirection: "Parent Link",
            linkTypeId: "linkTypeId",
            projectId: "Project1",
            lastUpdatedByUserId: updatedByUserId,
        },
    });
});
```

### 2. Using `Jest.mock()`

```js
// Define the implementation of the getUser and putVote function by calling jest.mock on the file path, 
jest.mock("../client/core", () => ({
    getUser: jest.fn(() =>
        Promise.resolve({
            displayName: "test user",
            accountId: "123",
            avatarUrls: {
                "48x48":
                    "http://localhost:2990/useravatar",
            },
        })
    ),
    putVote: jest.fn(() => Promise.resolve()),
)});
```

_**Note:** : But wait there is another way! If all you need is the return value of the promise but don't need to touch the implementation, you can use `mockResolvedValue()`. `mockResolvedValue` is synctatic sugar for `mockImplementation()` and only returns the resolved value of the mocked function!_
```js
mocked(getUser).mockResolvedValue({
            displayName: "test user",
            accountId: "123",
            avatarUrls: {
                "48x48":
                    "http://localhost:2990/useravatar",
            },
        });
// `mocked` or `jest.mocked` is used frequently to assign types to a function`
```

## Use case: Mocking modules.

Let's use mocking requests to Bugsnag as an example. Manual mocks are defined by writing a module in a `__mocks__/ subdirectory` immediately adjacent to the module. If the module you are mocking is a node module, the mock should be placed in the `__mocks__ directory` adjacent to `node_modules` .

In the `__mocks__` folder, define a file named `bugsnag.js` and then the following code block defines mocks for `bugsnag.notify()` and `bugsnag.leaveBreadcrumbs()`.

```js
export default {
    notify: jest.fn(),
    leaveBreadcrumb: jest.fn(),
};
```
## Use case: Mocking Atlaskit modules.

In a similar fashion to the above, we can also mock Atlaskit modules.
In this case, we are mocking out the `@atlaskit/modal-dialog` component due to the test having an extremely long run time.

```js
jest.mock("@atlaskit/modal-dialog", () => ({
    __esModule: true,
    default: ({ children }: any) => <div>{children}</div>,
    ModalTitle: ({ children }: any) => <h1>{children}</h1>,
    ModalBody: ({ children }: any) => <div>{children}</div>,
    ModalFooter: ({ children }: any) => <div>{children}</div>,
    ModalHeader: ({ children }: any) => <div>{children}</div>,
    ModalTransition: ({ children }: any) => <div>{children}</div>,
}));
```
_**Note:**: When using the factory parameter for an ES6 module with a default export, the `__esModule: true` property needs to be specified._

## Use-case: Mocking Redux Sagas.

In Redux Sagas, you can mock function calls in the `.provide` block.

```js
return expectSaga(thirdLevelSagas)
                    .provide([
                        [
                            matchers.call.fn(getLocalStorageLayout),
                            LevelsLayout.GROUPED_BY_THIRD,
                        ],
                        [
                            matchers.call(fetchEpicPage, totalFetchParams),
                            totalFetchResult,
                        ]
                        ]
                        );
                        ...
```

You can mock a function one of 2 ways,

  1. Using `call()` . To use `call()`, you need to provide arguments that the function accepts.
  
  ```js
  // In this case, we are providing totalFetchParams to the function fetchEpicPage.
  return expectSaga(thirdLevelSagas)
                    .provide([
                        [
                            matchers.call(fetchEpicPage, totalFetchParams),
                            totalFetchResult,
                        ])
                        ...
  ```

2. Using `call.fn()`. This is great to use if you only want to mock the return value and not the arguments.

```js
// In this case, we are NOT providing totalFetchParams to the function fetchEpicPage.
return expectSaga(thirdLevelSagas)
                    .provide([
                        [
                            matchers.call.fn(fetchEpicPage),
                            totalFetchResult,
                        ])
                        ...
```

A great tip when wanting to mock behaviour in sagas is to look at the <a href="https://redux-saga-test-plan.jeremyfairbank.com/integration-testing/mocking/static-providers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">matchers</a> documentation.  
I was able to mock a tricky race condition using `matchers.race(effects)` ðŸ˜….

This is a living document and I will be adding to it when I run into more mocks I find confusing. If Iâ€™ve got something wrong, Iâ€™m all ears!

Happy mocking!!
