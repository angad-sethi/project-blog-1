One of the primary benefits (in my opinion üòÑ) we recieve at <a href="https://www.easyagile.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Easy Agile</a> is getting to pledge 1% of our time (roughly 1 day a quarter) volunteering for any not for profit organisation.
I recently used one of these days to give back to some Open source tech we use to make our apps radical. I'm detailing the steps I took for my future self as well as to encourage you, the reader to do the same!
Now a lot of really intelligent people have written about this <a href ="https://kentcdodds.com/blog/first-timers-only" target="_blank" rel="noopener">before</a>, but having a familiar face write about it always makes it more tangible.

## Step 1.
Issues to fix, can be found by navigating to the Issues tab of a repository. Most open source libraries have a "good first issue" or "good for first timers" label in their issues page. These are issues I was mainly looking for to fix to take my first step into Open Source.

## Step 2.  
The biggest challenge I faced was to find an issue which met the following criteria,
    1. Open Source technology we use at Easy Agile.
    2. Good first issue label
    3. ~ 1 day of work.

I solved this by looking through <a href="https://up-for-grabs.net/#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Up for grabs</a> as well as <a href="https://goodfirstissue.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Good first issue</a> for Open source tech we use at Easy Agile. These sites only filter in good first issues and offer additional filtering by language as well. <a href="https://goodfirstissue.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Good first issue</a> also has this button that shows the summary of the issues so you don't have to click away while perusing!

## Step 3: 
Once a good issue that fits all your criteria is found, fork the Github repository and work your magic you open source dev rockstar! ‚ú® Commit and push as normal once you finish working on it. Once pushed to your fork, Github will offer you an option to create a pull request on the parent repository.

## Step 4: 
Create a PR, mention what your changes are and make sure the reviewers experience is as easy as it can be! Some repositories have strict guidelines in place and can be a bit tedious to create a PR that actually passes the Github actions so make sure you read the "contributing section" (<a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">example</a>) and fulfill what's necessary.
Once your PR is created, mention the code Owner and user who raised the issue that you have a fix up for it.

## Step 5: 
Make any necessary changes the reviewers ask for, if any. In my experience the code maintainers are super nice and very stoked to have someone fixing an issue.

## Step 6:
The best bit: watch your code get merged in and feel absolutely stoked to have contributed to a living and breathing technology that is being used by a large section of the world! ‚ù§Ô∏è
